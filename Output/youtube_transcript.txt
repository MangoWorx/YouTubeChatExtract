0.04 - 3.96: there's some big institutions lightening
2.12 - 3.96: their portfolios dumping billions of
4.0 - 3.839: dollars into the market uh but they're
6.08 - 3.479: doing it in a controlled way the market
7.839 - 3.84: drifts a little higher to resistance
9.559 - 4.0: they they unload you know few hundred
11.679 - 3.2: million or a billion dollars worth Drive
13.559 - 3.48: the market back down then they stop
14.879 - 4.001: selling they let the market repeat that
17.039 - 3.801: and we saw that all last week so these
18.88 - 3.559: are early warning signs that these huge
20.84 - 4.679: institutions are starting to lighten
22.439 - 6.281: their portfolios reduce exposure uh and
25.519 - 5.24: they take months to unload portfolios so
28.72 - 4.12: all it is is an early warning sign along
30.759 - 4.8: with other things gold and silver and
32.84 - 4.64: miners are telling us that um you know I
35.559 - 4.561: think we're very close to some type of
37.48 - 5.16: Black Swan event to a recession to a big
40.12 - 4.0: stock market reset uh obviously oil
42.64 - 4.28: taking off all these things we'll touch
44.12 - 4.919: on um are leading to I think a bigger
46.92 - 4.52: bearish picture for the economy and the
49.039 - 2.401: equities
52.239 - 4.041: markets hi and welcome to Wealthy on I'm
54.68 - 3.0: James Connor well here we are in the
56.28 - 3.0: last quarter of the year and there's so
57.68 - 3.64: much happening in the world the
59.28 - 4.56: financial markets are showing no signs
61.32 - 5.04: of weakness the S&P is making new highs
63.84 - 4.12: every other day every Central Bank
66.36 - 3.399: throughout the world is cutting interest
67.96 - 3.92: rates with the hopes of stimulating
69.759 - 3.881: economic growth so do we just keep
71.88 - 4.16: riding this wave Until It Breaks or
73.64 - 4.119: should we take a more defensive stance
76.04 - 6.039: to help answer this question my guest
77.759 - 4.32: today is Chris V Mulan of the technical
84.72 - 4.2: traders Chris thank you very much for
86.84 - 4.0: joining us today the last time we spoke
88.92 - 5.479: it was early August when Global markets
90.84 - 6.0: got hit the S&P was at 5100 now it's at
94.399 - 3.921: 5700 and at that time you were a little
96.84 - 3.04: bit concerned and thought the market was
98.32 - 4.439: topping out but here we are two months
99.88 - 5.279: later and the Market's much higher and
102.759 - 4.441: as I mentioned this S&P continues to
105.159 - 4.401: make new highs every other day and we
107.2 - 4.599: recently saw a very strong nonf Farms
109.56 - 3.919: number last week and before we start
111.799 - 4.121: looking at the charts maybe you can just
113.479 - 4.32: give us your view of the big macro
115.92 - 4.159: picture sure yeah well thanks for having
117.799 - 4.121: me James uh overall like when I look at
120.079 - 4.64: the big macro picture kind of the
121.92 - 4.76: overall view of what's going on I I I I
124.719 - 4.921: believe we are getting closer and closer
126.68 - 4.48: to a major Market reset uh but as you
129.64 - 3.44: just stated the market is still in a
131.16 - 4.12: very strong uptrend in fact that August
133.08 - 4.76: ShakeOut that you and I talked about and
135.28 - 4.4: were experiencing in our last talk uh
137.84 - 3.44: and the volatility that we've seen has
139.68 - 3.32: really kind of cleansed the market when
141.28 - 3.56: the market has a sharp pullback and a
143.0 - 3.879: pause a couple month pause like we've
144.84 - 3.8: just seen across the board it
146.879 - 3.761: re-energizes the market that could have
148.64 - 4.28: another push higher so
150.64 - 5.08: I do think overall equities have another
152.92 - 5.679: three to eight% upside on the SP 500 or
155.72 - 5.64: the NASDAQ if this traction continues
158.599 - 5.28: toh follow suit but in the big picture I
161.36 - 3.72: do feel like things are starting to slow
163.879 - 3.241: I think we're seeing you know
165.08 - 5.32: unemployment slowly creeping up although
167.12 - 5.24: it did dip a little bit um uh last week
170.4 - 4.199: but we're seeing delinquencies on credit
172.36 - 3.48: cards cards are maxed out and they're
174.599 - 3.36: they're going delinquent I think it's
175.84 - 3.679: one of the largest uh times ever we've
177.959 - 3.121: seen maxed out credit cards that are
179.519 - 4.241: delin inent a lot of people will just
181.08 - 4.4: have small small amounts of debt and
183.76 - 3.72: just not want to pay it but cards are
185.48 - 3.8: maxed out we've got residential
187.48 - 4.28: commercial real estate mortgages are
189.28 - 4.239: starting to default and take off we've
191.76 - 3.839: got a lot of defaults starting to happen
193.519 - 3.561: actually in the multif family which is
195.599 - 3.681: like not a good sign at all because
197.08 - 4.159: that's the most affordable to build has
199.28 - 4.08: the most potential so there's a lot of
201.239 - 3.761: stuff behind the scenes unfolding
203.36 - 3.959: telling us that you know people are
205.0 - 4.319: running out of money um people aren't
207.319 - 4.48: finishing projects everything's costing
209.319 - 4.521: more and we're seeing like leisure
211.799 - 3.961: activities has we've seen some of the
213.84 - 4.0: biggest Cuts in that area people just
215.76 - 4.6: aren't spending the same amount of money
217.84 - 4.959: as they use through travel um you know
220.36 - 4.92: all kinds of uh discretionary products
222.799 - 4.201: are coming to a grinding Halt and we've
225.28 - 3.239: seen the biggest layoffs in that space
227.0 - 3.64: so when people start closing their
228.519 - 4.201: wallets and tightening up uh it's going
230.64 - 4.159: to take a few months a quarter or so but
232.72 - 4.0: it'll Ripple through and we're seeing
234.799 - 3.52: you know cut in manufacturing which
236.72 - 3.879: manufacturing is like three or four
238.319 - 4.041: month lead time not getting the orders
240.599 - 3.761: from the stores so they're laying off
242.36 - 4.079: employees uh so there's a lot of stuff
244.36 - 3.4: coming down that by the end of this year
246.439 - 3.44: I think we could be like you know
247.76 - 5.24: getting very very weak in terms of
249.879 - 4.961: recession being a lot clearer um down
253.0 - 4.12: the road so that'll that'll tip the
254.84 - 3.6: scales and make people even more nervous
257.12 - 2.92: and it's kind of a self-fulfilling
258.44 - 4.759: prophecy I think we'll see equities and
260.04 - 5.439: things sell off and uh go from there so
263.199 - 4.201: I'm short-term bullish but longer term I
265.479 - 4.081: I see the music coming to an
267.4 - 3.799: end okay so why don't we start looking
269.56 - 3.919: at charts and why don't we take a look
271.199 - 4.72: at the S&P to begin with it's up 20% on
273.479 - 4.44: the year and it's currently trading
275.919 - 4.881: around 5700 you think there's another
277.919 - 4.161: three to four perc upside yeah I think
280.8 - 3.399: there's there's still some pretty good
282.08 - 4.88: upside I like to use Fibonacci extension
284.199 - 5.0: as a technical Trader which gauges how
286.96 - 4.56: much momentum there is and this big
289.199 - 4.601: correction that we saw back uh July
291.52 - 4.08: August if we we use a Fibonacci
293.8 - 5.399: extension which I find is the most
295.6 - 5.28: accurate tool to project upside targets
299.199 - 4.961: uh I only use two measurements on this I
300.88 - 6.84: use a 618 so meaning this rally and this
304.16 - 6.8: pullback if the market rallies 61% of
307.72 - 5.759: this first leg here and takes a pause
310.96 - 4.959: which it has we almost always go up and
313.479 - 6.401: hit this 100% measured move so there's
315.919 - 6.84: about 4% upside here on the SP 500 uh to
319.88 - 5.28: the upside the NASDAQ has about an 8%
322.759 - 3.921: upside potential uh based on its chart
325.16 - 3.44: pattern but it's this whole
326.68 - 4.2: consolidation right through here where
328.6 - 4.8: the vix spiked like
330.88 - 4.879: 175% we saw all kinds of
333.4 - 4.359: fear when the market has one of these
335.759 - 3.72: fear-driven events it cleanses the
337.759 - 4.121: market anybody who's who's going to get
339.479 - 4.72: shaken out got shaken out that's what
341.88 - 4.56: all of these are this one isn't quite as
344.199 - 4.521: severe but it led to the next major leg
346.44 - 4.28: up and of course this is another one of
348.72 - 4.08: these little pauses the smaller they are
350.72 - 3.88: the smaller the potential upside but
352.8 - 4.0: when we have one of these big ones it
354.6 - 5.28: can push the markets to have a pretty
356.8 - 5.0: big move um but we're definitely seeing
359.88 - 4.319: some warning signs La all last week we
361.8 - 4.679: saw distribution selling on the indexes
364.199 - 4.241: meaning every time the market drifted
366.479 - 4.041: higher on light volume we'd see Heavy
368.44 - 4.28: volume step in and Hammer the price
370.52 - 4.119: there's some big institutions lightening
372.72 - 4.0: their portfolios dumping billions of
374.639 - 3.801: dollars into the market uh but they're
376.72 - 3.44: doing it in a controlled way the market
378.44 - 3.84: drifts a little higher to resistance
380.16 - 4.0: they they unload you know few hundred
382.28 - 3.24: million or a billion dollars worth Drive
384.16 - 3.479: the market back down then they stop
385.52 - 4.119: selling they let the market repeat that
387.639 - 3.801: and we saw that all last week so these
389.639 - 3.361: are early warning signs that these huge
391.44 - 4.68: institutions are starting to lighten
393.0 - 6.319: their portfolios reduce exposure uh and
396.12 - 5.24: they take months to unload portfolio so
399.319 - 4.121: all it is is an early warning sign along
401.36 - 4.8: with other things gold and silver and
403.44 - 4.64: miners are telling us that um you know I
406.16 - 4.56: think we're very close to some type of
408.08 - 5.119: Black Swan event to a recession to a big
410.72 - 4.0: stock market reset uh obviously oil
413.199 - 4.321: taking off all these things we'll touch
414.72 - 5.0: on um are leading to I think a bigger
417.52 - 5.04: bearish picture for the economy and
419.72 - 4.039: equities markets yeah well to your point
422.56 - 3.0: it's going to be interesting to see
423.759 - 3.361: we're going to start seeing uh Q3
425.56 - 3.4: numbers coming out here in nnest in the
427.12 - 4.28: next couple of weeks the big first big
428.96 - 4.239: one is JP Morgan at the end of this week
431.4 - 3.16: and it's going to be interesting to see
433.199 - 3.201: the narrative coming out of these
434.56 - 4.0: companies just in terms of the consumer
436.4 - 5.12: and the health of the consumer so just
438.56 - 6.4: to recap here your shortterm Target on
441.52 - 6.399: the S&P would be 6,000 by the end of the
444.96 - 5.12: year yeah roughly about 6,000 yep and
447.919 - 4.761: why don't we move over to the NASDAQ now
450.08 - 4.72: and let's get your thoughts on that it's
452.68 - 4.72: also up 20% on the year but it's not
454.8 - 4.959: making new hives like the S&P
457.4 - 5.32: is yeah so it's struggling a little bit
459.759 - 4.761: more uh obviously everybody the mass has
462.72 - 4.36: always piled into the big Magnificent
464.52 - 4.079: Seven whatever is in the news and moving
467.08 - 4.28: for some reason the masses all want to
468.599 - 4.521: own it uh and so when the market starts
471.36 - 3.64: to correct they're all this they all
473.12 - 3.359: dump the same stock so the NASDAQ really
475.0 - 3.72: got hit and people are nervous we saw
476.479 - 4.921: like a 20 plus percent drop in the
478.72 - 4.879: markets and in IA um but we have seen
481.4 - 3.919: you know a rally we had a pullback and
483.599 - 4.32: now we're we're we're playing around
485.319 - 5.16: this 618 level and it's got about enough
487.919 - 5.24: to go up to about 21,000 or pretty much
490.479 - 5.28: a double top uh for the na for the
493.159 - 5.081: NASDAQ going forward so there is still
495.759 - 4.4: upside potential but definitely had
498.24 - 4.959: there's been some damage done people who
500.159 - 4.921: were involved in the Magnificent 7 um
503.199 - 3.201: really went for a roller coaster ride
505.08 - 3.32: and now they're a little gun shy and
506.4 - 4.079: that's why we're not seeing it go high
508.4 - 4.079: making new highs like the 500 it's just
510.479 - 3.24: people are nervous and uh they're
512.479 - 3.161: worried that it's going to be another
513.719 - 3.361: clap so this is not a good sign we want
515.64 - 3.199: to see the tech leading the way because
517.08 - 3.879: where Tech goes is pretty much going to
518.839 - 3.88: drag the rest of the market with it uh
520.959 - 4.081: but it's not quite as strong as the
522.719 - 3.841: overall broad Market here so you
525.04 - 3.44: mentioned Nvidia we got to take a look
526.56 - 6.32: at this this is the poster child now for
528.48 - 6.359: the NASDAQ it's up 150% on the year not
532.88 - 4.04: too far off its all-time highs it's had
534.839 - 3.601: a massive recovery from that low we saw
536.92 - 4.479: back in
538.44 - 5.28: August yeah I mean I I still like Nvidia
541.399 - 4.281: I mean it had that huge pullback I mean
543.72 - 4.88: that's enough to shake most investors
545.68 - 5.96: out and lots of panic and 3 almost 35%
548.6 - 5.52: pullback but overall it is it is a very
551.64 - 4.52: strong um pattern I mean this is how the
554.12 - 4.44: market moves it trades sideways it has a
556.16 - 4.119: rally it has a pullback it usually has
558.56 - 3.76: some type of shake out where investors
560.279 - 3.601: finally give up and then of course once
562.32 - 3.36: they bail out because they think it's
563.88 - 4.16: breaking down it shoots up for the next
565.68 - 4.24: leg and and it's creating another one of
568.04 - 4.039: these big pauses
569.92 - 3.64: and this definitely shook people out
572.079 - 3.921: right into this area now it's trying to
573.56 - 4.08: build a base and uh we we could see
576.0 - 4.6: Nvidia continue to go higher I mean the
577.64 - 5.48: CEO is saying there's insane demand I
580.6 - 5.64: think is specifically what he said for
583.12 - 4.719: their product uh and of course if if
586.24 - 3.36: that's the case Nvidia is going to be
587.839 - 3.721: going higher and where Nvidia goes
589.6 - 3.64: pretty much the whole Market goes or at
591.56 - 4.12: least the large major indexes are going
593.24 - 4.44: to get dragged up with it so uh while
595.68 - 4.12: it's you know it's not making new highs
597.68 - 4.0: it's definitely building a launch p and
599.8 - 3.159: it looks like this week this week it
601.68 - 3.0: could really start to break and run
602.959 - 4.56: higher I think the overall equities
604.68 - 4.839: Market wants to break and and run higher
607.519 - 4.361: this week uh it looks kind of primed and
609.519 - 4.44: ready and actually if we were're to just
611.88 - 5.12: kind of take a look at the Spy or the SP
613.959 - 6.761: 500 Index uh over the last uh few
617.0 - 6.16: sessions here um this this indicator
620.72 - 4.48: right here is our short-term 30 minute
623.16 - 3.88: chart and it tells us when the stock
625.2 - 4.16: market is dipping into an oversold
627.04 - 4.28: territory it's usually when we see these
629.36 - 4.039: lows that's usually when bargain hunters
631.32 - 4.4: step in and the market will start
633.399 - 4.321: another leg higher so the fact that
635.72 - 3.88: we've got these lime green bars and it
637.72 - 4.64: found support at this 20-day moving
639.6 - 4.679: average this is a very very bullish sign
642.36 - 4.719: this Market is primed and ready for that
644.279 - 6.161: pop and Invidia has a very similar Vibe
647.079 - 6.521: nvidia's ready to pop as Mo as well in
650.44 - 5.16: terms of uh the price action uh and
653.6 - 3.84: hopefully we'll see Nvidia really scream
655.6 - 3.2: higher here and break out which will
657.44 - 3.24: which will lead things up you can see if
658.8 - 5.159: we zoom on the chart it just dipped into
660.68 - 5.64: an oversold territory a few sessions ago
663.959 - 4.12: and now it's screaming to the upside so
666.32 - 5.6: these lime green are kind of like little
668.079 - 5.521: market resets people panicked out and uh
671.92 - 3.76: they they bail out the shares become
673.6 - 3.679: short-term oversold for a momentum
675.68 - 3.64: Trader and then you usually see the
677.279 - 4.24: market pop and rip the other way once
679.32 - 2.959: it's spooked out uh short-term Traders
681.519 - 2.44: and
682.279 - 3.521: investors yeah and I'm sure there's
683.959 - 3.721: people trying to short this thing every
685.8 - 3.2: day and uh yeah they're just going to
687.68 - 4.719: get sucked in and this thing looks like
689.0 - 5.48: a just wants to rip so we have to take a
692.399 - 4.24: look at China now because we had massive
694.48 - 6.68: news out of China a couple of weeks ago
696.639 - 7.44: and uh every one of those markets the
701.16 - 5.2: the Shanghai the Hong Kong and uh yeah
704.079 - 4.801: the the cs300 they they're all up like
706.36 - 4.479: 20% here in a very short period of time
708.88 - 4.56: what's your take here do these markets
710.839 - 4.761: keep going higher yeah I mean I don't
713.44 - 4.079: follow it too closely but I'm never a
715.6 - 4.64: huge fan of something that screams
717.519 - 4.521: higher on massive volume based on on
720.24 - 3.159: news I mean obviously there's stimulus
722.04 - 3.88: but if if we go and we look at the
723.399 - 5.161: monthly chart it's always really good to
725.92 - 5.24: take like that 35,000 foot
728.56 - 6.399: view if we just kind of draw a line
731.16 - 6.039: across here you know we've got pivot
734.959 - 4.041: highs we've got pivot lows we've got a
737.199 - 4.401: lot of price through here a lot of highs
739.0 - 5.04: and lows tagging this horizontal blue
741.6 - 4.96: line there's a ton of volume that's
744.04 - 4.159: traded through here since 2008 and
746.56 - 3.04: really it's popping back up and it's
748.199 - 3.32: going to be running right right into
749.6 - 4.52: this what I would call a ceiling a
751.519 - 5.76: resistance zone so I think most of the
754.12 - 5.279: upside is done um we'll we'll see this
757.279 - 4.68: is to me this is chasing a trade it's a
759.399 - 4.24: news driven move I'm not a huge fan of
761.959 - 3.641: trying to chase bubbles like this and
763.639 - 4.481: and and because they they can reverse
765.6 - 4.32: just as quick as they happen uh but I
768.12 - 3.279: would say hey most of the move is done
769.92 - 2.84: it's running into resistance it's
771.399 - 4.921: probably going to start to stall out
772.76 - 5.16: here um but definitely we've seen life I
776.32 - 3.6: mean when when you look at it like China
777.92 - 4.039: is like the ultimate and S it makes like
779.92 - 4.4: the US look like nothing China just does
781.959 - 4.56: all kinds of stuff to instantly fix
784.32 - 3.959: major scenarios where in the states it's
786.519 - 3.641: a slow dribble and they're trying not to
788.279 - 3.481: upset everybody but they they support
790.16 - 3.52: things but China just like puts their
791.76 - 4.04: foot on the gas pedal and does things
793.68 - 4.08: that dramatically turns things or tries
795.8 - 4.12: to turn things around uh they've got a
797.76 - 4.92: lot of issues over there but um I would
799.92 - 4.8: say Chinese stocks have had their fast
802.68 - 4.0: easy run if you didn't catch it which
804.72 - 3.44: would have almost been a fluke because
806.68 - 3.64: it happened just on news and you can
808.16 - 4.039: never predict when news is is coming out
810.32 - 3.759: um I would say most of that upside is
812.199 - 4.2: done at this point and the Chinese
814.079 - 5.161: market starts to roll over here or trade
816.399 - 5.56: um sideways then it might it might slow
819.24 - 4.08: down um the overall equities Market in
821.959 - 3.761: general as well because this is
823.32 - 4.68: definitely musling up uh some some
825.72 - 4.32: pretty big stocks and uh some heavy
828.0 - 4.88: weightings I don't know if you saw that
830.04 - 6.919: interview with David teer from appalossa
832.88 - 6.759: but he was on CNBC I believe last week
836.959 - 4.281: and he's all in on China and uh he's
839.639 - 3.681: pretty positive on the markets overall
841.24 - 4.88: and he thinks these two economies the US
843.32 - 5.48: and China together they represent 45% of
846.12 - 4.88: the global GDP and he thinks this is
848.8 - 3.399: just going to propel things higher so
851.0 - 3.88: you're it sounds like you have a little
852.199 - 4.721: bit of concern about China yeah I mean
854.88 - 3.959: if you if you I did this uh with a bunch
856.92 - 3.44: of investors uh last week in a mentoring
858.839 - 4.24: session so we pull up all the major
860.36 - 4.599: indexes Japan and and Germany and all
863.079 - 3.44: kinds of different indexes we all laid
864.959 - 4.361: them together we looked at the monthly
866.519 - 5.161: chart and when the US economy goes into
869.32 - 5.12: recession all other indexes go down when
871.68 - 4.56: they rally they all rally together I
874.44 - 4.12: believe we're coming into a major Market
876.24 - 4.92: top I think this stimulus plan is trying
878.56 - 4.639: to Kickstart things in China but overall
881.16 - 4.479: they pretty much all collapse and go
883.199 - 4.601: into into bare markets together so I'm
885.639 - 3.64: not one to try and pick the one horse
887.8 - 2.959: that might go the opposite direction as
889.279 - 3.441: the rest of the market I'd much rather
890.759 - 4.801: just be like hey if the whole economy
892.72 - 6.32: global economy is slowly slowing and
895.56 - 5.399: weakening um a pop like this is is very
899.04 - 4.479: very temporarily I think it'll
900.959 - 4.56: eventually just get sold into U again
903.519 - 4.24: it's a stimulus plan it's manipulation
905.519 - 6.081: manipulation and news driven moves are
907.759 - 5.401: usually um shaken out and re-evaluated
911.6 - 3.96: after the momentum is done a lot of
913.16 - 4.2: people follow China and huge these big
915.56 - 4.44: stimulus plans definitely move things
917.36 - 4.719: but uh I believe we're coming into more
920.0 - 3.6: so of a recession a global recession and
922.079 - 4.161: and this will just roll over and fizzle
923.6 - 4.719: out as we work up to this 38 level which
926.24 - 4.959: is that major blue line across that
928.319 - 5.32: chart so I'm I'm not really that bullish
931.199 - 5.041: on it I mean the markets are still in an
933.639 - 3.921: uptrend we are long equities here but if
936.24 - 2.399: you were to look forward a year from now
937.56 - 3.0: I believe everything is going to be
938.639 - 4.041: trading substantially
940.56 - 3.959: lower okay so one of the things that's
942.68 - 4.04: driving these Global markets are
944.519 - 4.161: interest rates and every major Central
946.72 - 4.16: Bank in the world has been cutting with
948.68 - 4.639: the exception of Japan so why don't we
950.88 - 3.68: take a look at the TLT that's a good
953.319 - 4.121: measure of what's happening with
954.56 - 6.719: interest rates and in the US the 10year
957.44 - 5.319: has just gone from 36 60 up to 4% now a
961.279 - 3.441: big a big part of this move has just
962.759 - 5.08: come on the back of these strong jobless
964.72 - 5.08: numbers we saw of the US but what do you
967.839 - 3.92: see here when you look at the
969.8 - 4.56: TLT yeah I mean there's there's a
971.759 - 5.64: definitely a huge move uh taking place
974.36 - 5.399: in in TLT like obviously we've seen a
977.399 - 5.56: huge massive correction in bonds with
979.759 - 4.961: the huge rise in interest rates but I
982.959 - 3.921: believe the equities Market more or less
984.72 - 4.2: is is starting to put in a major top and
986.88 - 3.759: will eventually sell off and usually
988.92 - 4.279: usually when one asset class falls out
990.639 - 5.601: of favor a new one will rise kind of
993.199 - 5.76: From the Ashes and so I believe the type
996.24 - 5.599: of price action we have on TLT is
998.959 - 5.12: indicative of a bottom um all of this
1001.839 - 4.36: stuff to me is you know a year from now
1004.079 - 5.0: I think we're going to be substantially
1006.199 - 5.161: higher um overall if we go into a
1009.079 - 4.041: recession and and and things get weak
1011.36 - 4.44: the fed's going to probably continue to
1013.12 - 4.12: cut rates and um I guess there's going
1015.8 - 3.719: to be inflation that's going to be the
1017.24 - 4.719: Wild Card of how much do they cut but
1019.519 - 4.761: overall usually we see the stock market
1021.959 - 5.401: sell off and then we'll see the FED step
1024.28 - 5.08: in trying to stimulate and start to drop
1027.36 - 3.199: rates and of course that will send bonds
1029.36 - 3.599: higher so I think there's some pretty
1030.559 - 5.801: good upside potential maybe 15
1032.959 - 5.36: 20% in TLT to the upside over the next
1036.36 - 5.28: year or so obviously won't go in a
1038.319 - 4.961: straight line but I believe uh I I
1041.64 - 2.88: believe we're going to see bonds become
1043.28 - 4.039: that defensive play We're actually
1044.52 - 5.08: seeing this more now just in the last uh
1047.319 - 4.641: couple of months finally bonds have gone
1049.6 - 5.48: back to how they moved the previous 40
1051.96 - 5.92: years um which is stock market goes up
1055.08 - 4.76: bonds kind of go down a bit if if stocks
1057.88 - 3.799: fall then bonds tend to move up so we're
1059.84 - 3.4: starting to get back to the way
1061.679 - 3.88: everybody's kind of used to how they
1063.24 - 4.48: move um obviously the last three or four
1065.559 - 3.841: years haven't been quite that way but I
1067.72 - 4.24: think we've turned that corner we're
1069.4 - 5.519: back into somewhat of the norm so I like
1071.96 - 4.76: bonds I do I do like bonds I the price
1074.919 - 4.281: of bonds because I think rates will
1076.72 - 5.12: slowly drift sideways and lower which
1079.2 - 5.2: means bonds will probably slowly rise
1081.84 - 5.16: and eventually
1084.4 - 4.2: rally so as you mentioned one of the big
1087.0 - 4.48: unknowns is inflation and one of the
1088.6 - 5.28: things that's really been helping us
1091.48 - 3.8: here the past year is the price of oil
1093.88 - 5.52: and it's been kind of hovering in
1095.28 - 5.48: between the 7080 a barrel and um but
1099.4 - 3.44: recently with the hostilities in the
1100.76 - 5.36: Middle East it has caught a bit of a a
1102.84 - 6.48: bid but what's your take on oil
1106.12 - 5.96: here yeah I mean I'm I'm I'm beish on
1109.32 - 4.4: oil to me the chart pattern is you know
1112.08 - 4.719: we've got a sell off and we've got a
1113.72 - 5.68: pause and usually this pause or this
1116.799 - 4.561: pennant formation uh is usually known as
1119.4 - 4.96: a halfway point and so whatever this
1121.36 - 5.08: first leg down was measures where you
1124.36 - 3.76: know the next one should go so I believe
1126.44 - 4.119: we're going to probably see like
1128.12 - 4.52: 4445 per barrel at some point which a
1130.559 - 5.801: lot of people say there's no way but in
1132.64 - 5.84: reality we've hit this $40 per barrel a
1136.36 - 2.92: ton of times going going back over the
1138.48 - 3.52: last
1139.28 - 5.279: you know 10 15 years or so it's not that
1142.0 - 4.6: significant in fact we went negative so
1144.559 - 4.881: I mean you can't really argue anything
1146.6 - 5.0: anymore in terms of where price could go
1149.44 - 3.84: uh so I do think that is probably going
1151.6 - 3.48: to be the case now obviously we have the
1153.28 - 3.759: Wild Card the Black Swan of you know the
1155.08 - 5.0: Middle East you know World War III going
1157.039 - 5.441: on and and and if bombs start flying uh
1160.08 - 4.8: then all bets are off oil will probably
1162.48 - 4.48: sky rocket gold will probably want to
1164.88 - 5.84: move higher as well typically those two
1166.96 - 6.28: go up in sync during uh massive war uh
1170.72 - 5.04: so other than that I do think most
1173.24 - 5.08: things are stalling out and and weak and
1175.76 - 5.039: I'm bearish on oil unless there is you
1178.32 - 5.479: know unless bombs start flying around
1180.799 - 5.88: and um you oil refineries start getting
1183.799 - 5.441: hit that'll probably completely make oil
1186.679 - 3.921: take off yeah it's amazing with
1189.24 - 4.12: everything that's going on in the world
1190.6 - 4.0: that oil is hanging in where it is and
1193.36 - 2.799: you got to wonder if we didn't have
1194.6 - 5.04: these hostilities and we didn't have the
1196.159 - 6.52: war in Ukraine oil would probably be at
1199.64 - 4.44: 40 or 50 bucks yeah and I think the I
1202.679 - 3.24: think the world has really changed a lot
1204.08 - 3.719: I remember back in the Gulf War and all
1205.919 - 4.601: that stuff going on it was such a
1207.799 - 4.801: different time now I mean when we hear
1210.52 - 4.159: War we're all I'm picturing are all
1212.6 - 5.36: those tracers across the skies and jets
1214.679 - 5.24: and bombs going off I mean that to me is
1217.96 - 4.16: like that's obviously what I picture in
1219.919 - 4.281: my head as War now it's just like a
1222.12 - 4.28: digital and like you know a digital war
1224.2 - 3.959: of zeros and ones and you know
1226.4 - 4.6: interviews and people bashing each other
1228.159 - 4.841: and people trading trade swapping trade
1231.0 - 4.28: policies who can buy this who can't buy
1233.0 - 4.96: that uh so it's really really different
1235.28 - 5.08: I think I think if we saw explosions in
1237.96 - 4.32: a big way in terms of refineries on fire
1240.36 - 4.799: and all that stuff it would probably
1242.28 - 6.04: dramatically change oil but I think um
1245.159 - 4.64: you know War right now is so is very
1248.32 - 4.52: different I think I mean I'm not in that
1249.799 - 5.841: space I don't know it but um it's just
1252.84 - 4.16: not the same as what we picture back in
1255.64 - 2.96: you know back a long time ago when there
1257.0 - 3.84: was like really guns going off in
1258.6 - 5.04: missiles going off uh so if those start
1260.84 - 4.8: to fly I think oil will do what we're
1263.64 - 3.84: expecting but I think people don't
1265.64 - 3.8: realize maybe how bad things are because
1267.48 - 3.439: it's all just information and we hear
1269.44 - 3.359: news all the time so we're all kind of
1270.919 - 3.721: like pretty numb to like oh there's
1272.799 - 3.801: another more tension in the Middle East
1274.64 - 4.279: and I mean we we've heard that forever
1276.6 - 3.28: so it doesn't really spark huge fear in
1278.919 - 3.321: my
1279.88 - 4.32: opinion yes and the other big difference
1282.24 - 5.679: too is the US is the world's largest oil
1284.2 - 5.44: producer now so right yeah that's also
1287.919 - 4.12: having a big
1289.64 - 4.56: and so why don't we uh also take a look
1292.039 - 4.681: at Exxon given that's the largest oil
1294.2 - 5.4: company in the world the largest
1296.72 - 5.16: publicly traded oil company I can't get
1299.6 - 5.76: over the strength of this thing it's a
1301.88 - 5.2: beast yeah I know it's I mean it it's on
1305.36 - 4.0: fire it's doing really well and this is
1307.08 - 4.16: one of those those warning signs when
1309.36 - 4.52: energy stocks are doing really well I
1311.24 - 4.679: think Exxon Mobile like I think PE
1313.88 - 3.72: people are are definitely into energy
1315.919 - 3.921: stocks they're they're doing very well
1317.6 - 5.04: they're trading up near I mean all-time
1319.84 - 4.68: highs um there's even the energy sector
1322.64 - 3.639: uh stocks if we were to go back using
1324.52 - 4.08: this monthly chart as well it's up at
1326.279 - 5.441: levels that we've seen during Major
1328.6 - 5.6: Market tops or recession Peaks um and
1331.72 - 5.079: and a good view of that is if we go back
1334.2 - 5.04: to the stage analysis of the markets
1336.799 - 3.921: there's these four stages of the markets
1339.24 - 4.36: I believe we're we're in this stage
1340.72 - 5.199: three which means after this we go into
1343.6 - 4.04: a major Financial reset but if we go
1345.919 - 4.521: down and look at the overall uh stock
1347.64 - 4.919: market Cycles which is this blue cycle
1350.44 - 4.52: we tend to see gold like Precious Metals
1352.559 - 5.72: do very well which we are Gold's hitting
1354.96 - 4.839: new all-time highs energy stocks tend to
1358.279 - 3.4: do exceptionally well which they're
1359.799 - 5.081: hitting as Exxon Mobile's new all-time
1361.679 - 5.561: highs the energy sector space is up near
1364.88 - 4.32: all-time highs and Industrial capital
1367.24 - 4.64: goods and all of these are early warning
1369.2 - 4.76: sign I think um you know precious metals
1371.88 - 4.399: to me like where where Gold's moving up
1373.96 - 4.12: I look at gold as like the world is like
1376.279 - 3.76: a beehive the whole planet and so
1378.08 - 3.92: whenever every body starts to buy gold
1380.039 - 3.561: it's the whole mentality of everybody
1382.0 - 3.799: saying okay there's bubbles everywhere
1383.6 - 4.559: there's uncertainty people don't trust
1385.799 - 4.12: stocks they don't trust currencies and
1388.159 - 4.281: so they move to physical Metals that's a
1389.919 - 5.041: huge red sign red flag that I think
1392.44 - 4.2: something bad is coming energy is more
1394.96 - 3.8: like there's some huge uncertainty in
1396.64 - 5.0: terms of war going on so energy stocks
1398.76 - 4.96: are taking off anticipating you know oil
1401.64 - 3.84: skyrocketing because there's all kinds
1403.72 - 5.12: of you know negative things starting to
1405.48 - 4.72: unfold the capital uh in capital goods
1408.84 - 3.4: all kinds of companies have had really
1410.2 - 3.68: good earnings manufacturers are
1412.24 - 3.799: upgrading their assembly lines they
1413.88 - 3.799: usually upgrade everything right after a
1416.039 - 3.921: strong business cycle and then we go
1417.679 - 5.161: into a recession so all those things are
1419.96 - 4.76: are starting to show and uh as you
1422.84 - 4.319: mentioned Exon Mobile the strength here
1424.72 - 4.12: is is is amazing this is a very strong
1427.159 - 5.361: chart pattern it's breaking out it's
1428.84 - 5.64: rallying up um and it's got potential to
1432.52 - 4.48: to want to keep on going this is a very
1434.48 - 4.4: strong chart pattern but eventually when
1437.0 - 4.44: the stock market does start to top out
1438.88 - 4.279: all of these will fall gold will fall
1441.44 - 4.119: Industrials energy stocks they'll all
1443.159 - 5.481: get hammered and clobbered pretty good
1445.559 - 4.36: but um right now they're they're they're
1448.64 - 4.36: leading the way and it's actually a
1449.919 - 6.24: warning sign of of the markets late
1453.0 - 4.6: stages of a bull market coming to an end
1456.159 - 2.64: okay so you mentioned gold a couple of
1457.6 - 3.64: times why don't we take a look at the
1458.799 - 4.841: gold chart here it's up 25% on the year
1461.24 - 5.08: give or take where do you see gold
1463.64 - 5.24: going gold has pretty much made its run
1466.32 - 4.359: so Gold's got these massive super cycle
1468.88 - 3.48: uh waves and and really if we were to
1470.679 - 5.521: look at the last Super Cycle that
1472.36 - 7.4: started in early 2000s to the 2011 Peak
1476.2 - 7.24: and down into this 2015 uh low we can
1479.76 - 5.12: carry that forward and this kind of goes
1483.44 - 3.92: back to one thing we talked about
1484.88 - 4.039: earlier which is you know Fibonacci
1487.36 - 3.799: tells us how much momentum there is so
1488.919 - 6.201: we had this first run up and then we had
1491.159 - 6.561: the pullback and based on this power we
1495.12 - 5.48: can gauge where it should run to next
1497.72 - 5.679: and here is that 618 level when you hit
1500.6 - 4.319: 618 and usually take a pause we almost
1503.399 - 3.201: always run up it doesn't matter the
1504.919 - 3.721: asset class I find this works on
1506.6 - 4.4: absolutely everything you'll run up and
1508.64 - 4.6: you'll hit that 100% one is a 100%
1511.0 - 4.48: measured move so this run up is
1513.24 - 4.88: equivalent to this runup and so we're
1515.48 - 4.96: pretty much there and uh last time you
1518.12 - 4.84: and I talked James I was saying hey if
1520.44 - 5.56: when gold hits like 2700 or
1522.96 - 5.52: 2750 I think we are bloody close to a
1526.0 - 5.559: major Market top because this is the
1528.48 - 5.4: 20year chart pattern or more or less a
1531.559 - 4.36: 12 or 14e chart pattern pointing to
1533.88 - 4.039: where we should land here and everything
1535.919 - 4.12: is unfolded exactly as we've been
1537.919 - 4.081: anticipating for the last several years
1540.039 - 4.12: and now we're we're at this level in
1542.0 - 5.36: Gold's at all-time highs energy stocks
1544.159 - 6.24: at all-time highs um you all kinds of
1547.36 - 5.0: chaoses happening Wars happening and uh
1550.399 - 4.561: this this big strong rally that we've
1552.36 - 4.36: got in gold is very similar to what
1554.96 - 4.24: happened let me just clear this chart
1556.72 - 5.92: what happened just before
1559.2 - 6.4: 2008 financial crisis we saw gold after
1562.64 - 5.08: had broken into a bull market phase it
1565.6 - 3.64: it paused well stock market rallied and
1567.72 - 3.64: then everybody started to pile into gold
1569.24 - 4.08: there were bubbles everywhere in 2007
1571.36 - 4.88: stocks were overvalued homes were
1573.32 - 5.239: overvalued all kinds of uh global
1576.24 - 4.72: concerns and then the stock market took
1578.559 - 4.72: a correction and gold pulled back about
1580.96 - 4.4: 34% well we've had the same we had a new
1583.279 - 4.4: super cycle start we just had a
1585.36 - 4.08: multi-year pause in Gold while stocks
1587.679 - 4.0: Skyrock rocketed for the last several
1589.44 - 5.239: years and they're still going up but now
1591.679 - 5.12: gold is is doing what it did in 2007
1594.679 - 4.401: it's outperforming it's caught up
1596.799 - 3.801: outperformed the stock market and this
1599.08 - 3.0: is telling us the world knows something
1600.6 - 3.799: bad is coming and we're probably going
1602.08 - 5.24: to go into some type of sharp pullback
1604.399 - 4.081: and reset before we see things go go
1607.32 - 4.4: higher I do think we're going to see
1608.48 - 5.76: gold 35 5,000 and change over the next
1611.72 - 4.6: several years but I do think this whole
1614.24 - 4.6: move has played out I don't think
1616.32 - 4.44: there's a lot of upside much upside at
1618.84 - 5.24: all in the precious metal space very
1620.76 - 4.639: little uh until it resets and then
1624.08 - 3.719: obviously the wild card will be if
1625.399 - 4.4: there's like a full-on war then gold
1627.799 - 5.041: could squeeze up and and really shoot
1629.799 - 4.48: parabolic uh even higher but again as
1632.84 - 3.52: soon as that Fizzles out we're going to
1634.279 - 4.721: see gold pull back and probably have a
1636.36 - 4.799: 15 20 or 30% pullback and that would
1639.0 - 4.2: bring it right back down into this
1641.159 - 3.721: consolidation um which happens to be
1643.2 - 3.4: percentage wise the same as this one
1644.88 - 4.72: here it pulled all the way back down to
1646.6 - 5.12: the multi-year consolid Val so I'm
1649.6 - 3.679: really bullish on gold long term this
1651.72 - 2.72: whole thing has played out as as even
1653.279 - 2.481: you and I have talked about over the
1654.44 - 3.239: last several months when since we've
1655.76 - 2.919: been talking and now I think we're at
1657.679 - 2.561: the point where it's like okay I'm
1658.679 - 3.24: stepping away I'm not looking to really
1660.24 - 3.919: take advantage of precious medals at all
1661.919 - 4.281: anymore now I'm letting them gonna
1664.159 - 4.601: cleanse themselves there'll be a new
1666.2 - 4.839: opportunity uh to the upside I think
1668.76 - 5.12: after we have the markets
1671.039 - 4.681: reset so one of the big differences
1673.88 - 3.36: between what's happening now in the gold
1675.72 - 3.16: sector and what happened back in the
1677.24 - 3.4: early 2000s
1678.88 - 3.72: was the move in the gold equities and
1680.64 - 3.399: we're really not seeing that now and why
1682.6 - 4.12: don't we take a look at numont and use
1684.039 - 5.401: this as an example back in the early
1686.72 - 6.4: 2000 the gold equities were trading at a
1689.44 - 5.359: big premium to their navs and and now
1693.12 - 4.64: there's very few names that are trading
1694.799 - 4.72: at premiums to their NBS um when you
1697.76 - 2.799: look at numont for example what do you
1699.519 - 3.441: see
1700.559 - 4.281: here yeah I mean it's it's a pretty ugly
1702.96 - 4.12: chart I'm not a fan of something that's
1704.84 - 4.52: uh you know really just oscillated in
1707.08 - 5.64: big volatile ranges for the last you
1709.36 - 5.84: know 24 years uh overall to me it's a
1712.72 - 4.72: pretty ugly chart it obviously has had a
1715.2 - 4.88: this is the monthly chart uh it's had a
1717.44 - 4.76: very nice run uh it is definitely stuck
1720.08 - 4.479: at resistance if we just connect these
1722.2 - 4.599: from a technical standpoint you know
1724.559 - 4.48: usually you have a floor support level
1726.799 - 4.561: but once you break it it becomes
1729.039 - 5.0: resistance um we've just had a very
1731.36 - 4.799: strong move up to this level and if I
1734.039 - 3.401: was to just draw a line right across
1736.159 - 3.601: here as well you can see it's
1737.44 - 5.44: significant High significant lows a
1739.76 - 5.919: breakout a high a couple highs a topping
1742.88 - 6.039: phase so Newmont is is running into
1745.679 - 4.6: resistance and um you know it's it's
1748.919 - 3.721: definitely struggling it actually you
1750.279 - 4.201: can see on the uh on the monthly chart
1752.64 - 3.32: here when you zoom into this bar had a
1754.48 - 3.16: little bit of a run and pushup and then
1755.96 - 5.439: it's it's getting sold into so there's
1757.64 - 5.399: sellers lurking up there um again not a
1761.399 - 3.081: whole lot of upside potential maybe it
1763.039 - 3.64: has a little bit of a squeeze up or
1764.48 - 3.72: something a little shake out but overall
1766.679 - 4.041: I think you know the pressure smells
1768.2 - 5.52: space is not really going to be that
1770.72 - 4.679: exciting until we go into a financial
1773.72 - 3.679: reset and everything gets cleansed and
1775.399 - 4.441: we'll probably see gold stocks trading
1777.399 - 4.841: dramatically lower back down the lower
1779.84 - 5.52: end of this range probably down in the
1782.24 - 5.12: uh mid 20s or down the 30 level uh for
1785.36 - 4.64: Newmont and and then from there it could
1787.36 - 4.12: go into a huge run in rally but I'm not
1790.0 - 3.919: a huge fan of this stock I mean
1791.48 - 5.199: obviously it's huge uh in terms of the
1793.919 - 4.841: company itself but uh percentage wise
1796.679 - 4.201: it's it's uh I think there's other
1798.76 - 4.279: places you could get into and trade
1800.88 - 5.12: without a lot of this chopping noise I
1803.039 - 5.921: do like you know GDX or any of the gold
1806.0 - 5.44: minor ETF baskets kind of as a whole I
1808.96 - 5.24: find they're a little bit cleaner um
1811.44 - 4.88: when we look at the precious metal space
1814.2 - 3.959: you know they have formed a much cleaner
1816.32 - 4.599: pattern in terms of they've put in like
1818.159 - 5.441: a a rounding bottom here a pretty major
1820.919 - 4.841: base through here they kind of broke
1823.6 - 4.079: through now they're sitting on top
1825.76 - 3.399: finding this traction I I I think
1827.679 - 3.48: they're might be a little bit of upside
1829.159 - 4.041: but overall we need to wait for the
1831.159 - 3.201: stock market and everything to reset and
1833.2 - 4.28: then I think we're going to see these
1834.36 - 4.319: really take off um going forward so
1837.48 - 3.6: again everything is kind of waiting
1838.679 - 4.88: we're in that wait and see mode long the
1841.08 - 5.04: stock indexes the precious metal space I
1843.559 - 4.641: think is pretty much run its course for
1846.12 - 4.399: a little while let it reset and then
1848.2 - 4.52: it'll be like all Hands-On deck uh when
1850.519 - 7.04: that super cycle comes into play very
1852.72 - 6.76: similar to 200 um 2008 uh where we could
1857.559 - 3.801: see Miners and and everything really
1859.48 - 3.919: take off and that's kind of this is what
1861.36 - 3.84: we're waiting for so this opportunity
1863.399 - 3.52: right here that a lot of us played it's
1865.2 - 4.359: a life-changing move in a lot of gold
1866.919 - 5.72: mining stocks uh that'll be like over
1869.559 - 4.641: here I believe we're getting closer and
1872.639 - 4.081: uh this is the monthly chart so this
1874.2 - 4.56: could still be 6 eight 12 months out but
1876.72 - 4.679: we're actually getting very very close
1878.76 - 5.399: to I think that type of scenario where
1881.399 - 5.841: we can get into the you know any type of
1884.159 - 5.48: precious metal Miner at that point but
1887.24 - 4.799: so yeah so this this is a better example
1889.639 - 4.201: of what's happening in the gold sector
1892.039 - 4.281: as opposed to Numa because this is
1893.84 - 5.24: comprised of a back basket of stocks but
1896.32 - 5.16: once again physical gold is trading at
1899.08 - 4.599: all-time Highs but these gold equities
1901.48 - 3.84: are nowhere near yeah they're just not
1903.679 - 3.641: participating there isn't the light like
1905.32 - 3.68: they've had a nice run but in the grand
1907.32 - 3.839: scheme of things like gold gold is
1909.0 - 4.639: trading to equivalent to like up here
1911.159 - 4.041: and and miners are way off they're just
1913.639 - 3.4: it's not the right time for them and
1915.2 - 3.64: this is the problem with you know a lot
1917.039 - 3.721: of people will follow one specific
1918.84 - 3.64: sector or asset class and then they wait
1920.76 - 4.399: like a decade for them to come back to
1922.48 - 5.199: life uh this is this is the problem
1925.159 - 5.0: there's the windows where a specific
1927.679 - 4.441: asset like this come to life is very
1930.159 - 3.561: short it only lasts a few years if you
1932.12 - 4.24: catch those few years they life changing
1933.72 - 5.439: in terms of financial returns but you
1936.36 - 6.64: need to like step away and and let them
1939.159 - 5.921: reset and build and um we're just not at
1943.0 - 4.559: that phase yet but we're we're very
1945.08 - 4.76: close to them wanting to to take take
1947.559 - 4.761: action and and we'll start to see a lot
1949.84 - 4.88: of action a lot of money start moving in
1952.32 - 4.64: uh you know and that'll be a big red a
1954.72 - 3.959: big flag saying hey it's starting to
1956.96 - 4.24: come to life but we're not quite there
1958.679 - 4.24: yet all right so we Gold's trading at
1961.2 - 3.079: all-time Highs but silver is nowhere
1962.919 - 4.201: near let's take a look at the silver
1964.279 - 4.721: chart and get your views on that yeah
1967.12 - 3.36: Silver's got a really nice looking chart
1969.0 - 4.399: it's it's been moving up I've been
1970.48 - 5.28: expecting it to go to about 34 to 36
1973.399 - 4.28: somewhere in this this area bring it
1975.76 - 2.6: back up into these kind of highs over
1977.679 - 4.48: here
1978.36 - 5.96: here uh so silver very similar to the
1982.159 - 5.76: gold miners I find gold miners and
1984.32 - 5.88: silver are kind of um same mentality
1987.919 - 4.441: it's the same waves in fear it had that
1990.2 - 4.839: kind of bottoming formation you know
1992.36 - 5.319: more or less it's kind of created that
1995.039 - 4.6: launch pad and it's moving up now it is
1997.679 - 3.401: a little bit it's a little higher than
1999.639 - 2.961: the miners because I find it's
2001.08 - 3.4: disconnected from the stock market
2002.6 - 4.28: people are moving into silver so there's
2004.48 - 3.84: still some more upside this this is got
2006.88 - 3.44: a nice little chart pattern we still
2008.32 - 3.959: might see a squeeze up but once it gets
2010.32 - 4.12: into this resistance Zone where we've
2012.279 - 4.041: got significant lows we've got a couple
2014.44 - 3.64: significant highs three through three
2016.32 - 3.719: highs through here this is going to act
2018.08 - 3.68: as a major resistance zone so I do think
2020.039 - 3.64: we could still still see silver and
2021.76 - 4.639: Miners and gold have one more little
2023.679 - 4.12: squeeze and pop up U but I do feel like
2026.399 - 4.0: after that you know we're going to see
2027.799 - 5.0: some type of reset and pullback uh but
2030.399 - 4.921: silver obviously moving up I like I like
2032.799 - 4.6: Metals in this situation more than the
2035.32 - 3.92: miners because they're disconnected from
2037.399 - 4.321: the stock market so if the stock market
2039.24 - 4.36: starts to sell off the precious metal
2041.72 - 3.6: space they're a physical asset they're
2043.6 - 3.16: outside of the equi market they can
2045.32 - 5.2: actually keep moving up and that's what
2046.76 - 6.56: we've seen before where uh gold
2050.52 - 4.72: continues to rally and moves higher
2053.32 - 3.72: dramatically well gold miners actually
2055.24 - 4.159: trade sideways because the stock market
2057.04 - 3.879: Goes Down And as everybody knows who
2059.399 - 3.121: follows me I look at the stock market
2060.919 - 4.041: like the ocean tide When the tide goes
2062.52 - 3.92: down all boats go down so you don't and
2064.96 - 3.0: when the stock market goes down all
2066.44 - 2.919: stocks go down so you don't want to hold
2067.96 - 3.399: gold miners even though they're in a
2069.359 - 3.56: favorable environment there's still a
2071.359 - 3.32: stock they're a boat on the water
2072.919 - 3.121: getting pulled down with the rest you
2074.679 - 3.801: got to get out of the equities and then
2076.04 - 3.799: go to physical silver or gold they're
2078.48 - 3.56: the ones that can kind of drift and
2079.839 - 4.56: continue to move higher uh while their
2082.04 - 3.599: equities Market is under pressure and uh
2084.399 - 2.841: people don't want to move to Gold
2085.639 - 2.881: because it's like you know people who
2087.24 - 2.879: trade miners because they want the
2088.52 - 3.68: volatility but the reality is you
2090.119 - 3.72: actually can make more with a really
2092.2 - 3.08: conservative play because it'll
2093.839 - 4.0: naturally Buck the trend and want to
2095.28 - 4.52: move higher well miners are subject to
2097.839 - 4.28: selling pressures in the equities Market
2099.8 - 4.92: but uh uh that's the problem if you try
2102.119 - 3.881: and Chase big returns all the time uh
2104.72 - 2.56: believe it or not some of the best
2106.0 - 3.839: returns are actually in the slower
2107.28 - 4.52: moving assets H but people just don't
2109.839 - 4.161: see that they they want the volatility
2111.8 - 4.16: they they want to try and swing for the
2114.0 - 3.64: fences okay Chris I want to ask you
2115.96 - 3.879: about one more metal before we move on
2117.64 - 4.12: and that's uranium I in my opinion I
2119.839 - 5.841: don't think there's another commodity
2121.76 - 5.44: that has a more positive backdrop than
2125.68 - 4.28: what's happening within the nuclear
2127.2 - 4.36: energy sector in uranium and when you
2129.96 - 4.56: look at the Sprout physical uranium
2131.56 - 5.32: trust or spot what do you think of this
2134.52 - 4.44: chart yeah I mean this is a really
2136.88 - 4.4: strong chart uh just using Fibonacci
2138.96 - 5.24: extension based off this last level here
2141.28 - 5.16: we can we can get a gauge of where this
2144.2 - 4.2: could run this is a super strong looking
2146.44 - 4.879: bull flag pattern as a as a technical
2148.4 - 5.32: Trader a bull flag pattern is it creates
2151.319 - 4.28: a flag pull so a move up and then a flag
2153.72 - 4.52: usually Flags in the opposite direction
2155.599 - 4.201: in the wind flagging downward and then
2158.24 - 4.0: here's the second half of this move
2159.8 - 4.0: should bring us up to 618 level and then
2162.24 - 4.599: from there it can run all the way up to
2163.8 - 6.08: 32 so 2650 to to
2166.839 - 5.201: 3250 um is the upside potential based on
2169.88 - 5.0: on this chart and from where that is
2172.04 - 6.36: that's a 60% upside move
2174.88 - 4.959: 61 um potential if this was to unfold
2178.4 - 3.48: now this is the monthly chart so
2179.839 - 4.28: obviously this could take very similar
2181.88 - 4.76: to this one is which is a one two three
2184.119 - 5.641: four five six seven seven or eight
2186.64 - 5.08: months uh minus two here so you know in
2189.76 - 4.72: five months it could potentially run up
2191.72 - 5.24: there um so it does have a very strong
2194.48 - 4.639: chart pattern and uh it is pointing to
2196.96 - 3.639: higher pricing and uh see if we can get
2199.119 - 4.24: some traction
2200.599 - 5.681: here the second largest uranium producer
2203.359 - 5.361: in the world is camoo it's based in
2206.28 - 3.72: Canada why don't we take a look at that
2208.72 - 3.599: yeah Cho's got a little bit of
2210.0 - 4.599: volatility I think uh the the big
2212.319 - 4.481: sell-off we saw kind of this summer in
2214.599 - 4.0: the overall stock market created a
2216.8 - 3.559: little bit of a p I don't like which is
2218.599 - 4.041: a broadening formation you got higher
2220.359 - 4.76: highs lower lows it's known as a
2222.64 - 4.6: megaphone pattern uh it just means
2225.119 - 4.72: volatility is increasing it's rallying
2227.24 - 5.16: up but it's it's to higher Highs but
2229.839 - 6.201: it's also selling off to lower lows it's
2232.4 - 6.32: a sign of U you know indecision increas
2236.04 - 5.079: volatility generally means your the
2238.72 - 4.04: previous move which would be this move
2241.119 - 4.281: up is running out of steam and
2242.76 - 5.52: eventually you know it could roll over
2245.4 - 4.28: so um there is there there is definitely
2248.28 - 3.559: a little bit of weakness in this
2249.68 - 4.679: megaphone pattern it's much better when
2251.839 - 5.161: price consolidates into like a narrowing
2254.359 - 5.401: pattern so it rallies up and then pauses
2257.0 - 4.119: and then breaks out uh so increased
2259.76 - 3.64: volatility obviously you need to be
2261.119 - 4.081: aware it's going to can probably
2263.4 - 4.32: continue to be more volatile so you have
2265.2 - 4.28: to take smaller positions manage those
2267.72 - 3.56: um I'm not a huge fan of this chart
2269.48 - 5.04: pattern I like the other chart we just
2271.28 - 6.799: looked at the Sprout one uh much more
2274.52 - 5.24: than this just because um this at any
2278.079 - 3.561: point could sell right back down or it
2279.76 - 4.24: might push up to higher highs it just
2281.64 - 4.4: doesn't have a very super strong chart
2284.0 - 4.72: pattern it looks like a sign of kind of
2286.04 - 5.319: exhaustion uh that's not my my favorite
2288.72 - 5.08: type of pattern do you see a potential
2291.359 - 5.24: double top forming
2293.8 - 5.96: here um I would say com back up to that
2296.599 - 5.52: $56 level yeah so let's we'll just drop
2299.76 - 4.76: down to the the daily chart real quick
2302.119 - 4.881: and kind of um get a bit more of a
2304.52 - 4.4: granular look yeah you could argue a few
2307.0 - 4.24: different things like um you could say
2308.92 - 4.08: there's a shoulder and a head and a
2311.24 - 3.68: shoulder forming and it's usually known
2313.0 - 6.48: as a major topping pattern and it's got
2314.92 - 7.24: a sloping down neckline which isn't good
2319.48 - 4.24: um it's to yeah I mean it's hard to say
2322.16 - 3.199: to me this is a pretty ugly chart I just
2323.72 - 3.96: don't I wouldn't trade this I would look
2325.359 - 4.441: for a different uh uranium stock to
2327.68 - 6.2: trade but it's definitely right up into
2329.8 - 6.799: resistance it's had a very strong move
2333.88 - 4.12: um yeah to me it's just a kind of an
2336.599 - 2.72: ugly chart I wouldn't I wouldn't trade
2338.0 - 2.68: it I don't know what to do here that's
2339.319 - 2.961: why I wouldn't touch it is because it
2340.68 - 3.6: doesn't give you any clear Direction
2342.28 - 4.6: you're really just taking a stab at you
2344.28 - 6.039: know random total random guess of of
2346.88 - 5.56: which way we go um yeah so that's a good
2350.319 - 3.481: overview of the various markets and in
2352.44 - 2.879: the last few minutes Chris I just want
2353.8 - 3.12: to spend uh a little bit of time
2355.319 - 4.201: summarizing what you think's going to
2356.92 - 4.36: happen here in the coming months and you
2359.52 - 4.16: said you're bullish on the S&P and the
2361.28 - 4.6: NASDAQ here as we go into year end but
2363.68 - 3.48: then come q1 Q2 you think the Market's
2365.88 - 4.36: going to top out and we're going to see
2367.16 - 5.439: a downward spiral what's going to create
2370.24 - 4.4: this downward movement in the
2372.599 - 3.72: markets yeah that's a good question I
2374.64 - 3.28: mean pretty much whatever whatever
2376.319 - 3.52: creates it you know we don't know what
2377.92 - 3.36: it will be until it happens and then
2379.839 - 3.201: after the bare Market everybody will
2381.28 - 3.839: label label it as something like you
2383.04 - 5.44: know the tech bubble or the Global
2385.119 - 6.161: Financial you know crisis
2388.48 - 5.4: um usually it's always the same thing
2391.28 - 4.48: it's buying momentum has stalled sales
2393.88 - 4.0: for companies are starting to slow
2395.76 - 3.559: people start to sell stocks
2397.88 - 3.04: we're we're already seeing in the United
2399.319 - 4.241: States people have burnt through their
2400.92 - 4.36: cash reserves uh credit card debt is
2403.56 - 4.48: skyrocketing people can't pay them
2405.28 - 4.12: mortgages are going up so to me you know
2408.04 - 2.88: somebody always wants to throw a label
2409.4 - 3.199: on it everybody's like what what caused
2410.92 - 4.199: it everybody wants to know why it
2412.599 - 4.561: doesn't really I I wouldn't throw one
2415.119 - 4.441: particular thing I would just say we've
2417.16 - 3.919: had an incredible bull market I think
2419.56 - 4.16: there's been a lot of different stimulus
2421.079 - 4.561: things going on I think the cycle is
2423.72 - 3.879: just coming to an end things can only be
2425.64 - 4.8: pushed and stretched so far and we're
2427.599 - 6.041: starting to see you know um all kinds of
2430.44 - 5.72: weakness in in certain assets or certain
2433.64 - 6.199: economic data slowly starting to lose
2436.16 - 5.12: momentum or change direction um and so I
2439.839 - 3.161: really just think it's just a cycle I
2441.28 - 4.92: mean this we go through these all the
2443.0 - 4.64: time um major Cycles throughout uh the
2446.2 - 4.36: economy and the stock market so I just
2447.64 - 4.92: think we're running out of steam and um
2450.56 - 4.2: once that momentum once the things start
2452.56 - 4.12: to roll over and the momentum shifts
2454.76 - 3.64: Directions That's when things actually
2456.68 - 3.159: pick up speed because now businesses are
2458.4 - 3.48: like oh man things have actually turned
2459.839 - 4.641: a corner businesses tighten up on
2461.88 - 4.76: spending they start laying off uh and
2464.48 - 3.839: people start obviously employment starts
2466.64 - 4.0: to go up so it's just this whole string
2468.319 - 3.601: of things that kind of happen naturally
2470.64 - 5.0: and we could say it's going to be some
2471.92 - 5.32: AI bubble or whatever you know covid
2475.64 - 4.64: bubble has burst or whatever they're
2477.24 - 4.839: going to call it but it really is just
2480.28 - 3.68: time has done its thing we've all got
2482.079 - 4.24: super greedy everybody there's bubbles
2483.96 - 4.879: everywhere and they just need to burst
2486.319 - 4.361: and reset it's you know things always
2488.839 - 3.881: get stretched to too far in each
2490.68 - 4.04: Direction and eventually they kind of
2492.72 - 5.24: break and they revert to the mean or
2494.72 - 6.44: Beyond and and then turn around again so
2497.96 - 6.119: it's just time I think um in terms of
2501.16 - 3.919: what is doing it it's just a cycle well
2504.079 - 2.641: I think it's going to be very
2505.079 - 4.081: interesting to see what companies are
2506.72 - 4.56: saying with their Q3 numbers we had many
2509.16 - 3.84: companies during Q2 they came out and
2511.28 - 4.559: that said they saw a lot of weakness
2513.0 - 5.119: within the uh the American Consumer and
2515.839 - 5.681: numerous companies Starbucks
2518.119 - 5.601: McDonald's Nike Airbnb and Home Depot
2521.52 - 5.0: and so many more so it's I think that
2523.72 - 6.76: could be a potential yeah um sign of
2526.52 - 5.799: trouble right there for sure so Chris as
